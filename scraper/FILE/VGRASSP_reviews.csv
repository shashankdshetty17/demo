74,"Pros:400 games. Some games are simple to play. Good distraction for small kids from smartphones. Price seems just right for what they offer (with the deal of 60% off and not msrp)Cons:More than half of games are similar with just UI change. Build quality is extremely cheap(anything from screen to button and inner board). Screen size and image quality is utter rubbish. Long hours of usage is bad for eyes of kids. Old nokia phone batteries are used(bl-4d). Take too long to charge and discharges much faster.No. But, I don't think there is anything anywhere near the budget that can be offered with these features with good build quality. Guess cheap quality chinese products are the only options out there. If better options are available, do hunt it out.
